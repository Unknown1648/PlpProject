	</section>
	<section>
		<h4>Minors</h4>
		<p>We do not sell the personal data of consumers we know to be less than 18 years of age, unless we receive affirmative authorization (the “Right to Opt In”) from either the minor who is between 13 and 17 years of age, or the parent or guardian of a minor less than 13 years of age.

			If you are under the age of 18 and you want to remove your name or comments from our website or publicly displayed content, please contact us directly at <a href="mailto:niHome2024@outlook.com">niHome2024@outlook.com</a>. We may not be able to modify or delete your information in all circumstances.
			
			If you wish to submit a privacy request on behalf of your minor child in accordance with applicable jurisdictional laws, you must provide sufficient information to allow us to reasonably verify your child is the person about whom we collected personal information and you are authorized to submit the request on your child’s behalf (i.e., you are the child’s legal guardian or authorized representative).</p>
